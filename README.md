# 🎓 Face Recognition Attendance System using OpenCV and PIL

This project is an AI-based **Attendance System** that uses **face detection and recognition** to automatically mark attendance in real-time. It captures face images using a webcam, trains a face recognizer using Haar Cascades, and logs attendance with timestamps into a `.csv` file.
