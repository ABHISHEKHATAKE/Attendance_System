# Attendance_System
This project is an intelligent, real-time face recognition-based attendance system that uses OpenCV (cv2) and PIL to automate attendance marking. It captures face images via webcam, trains a face recognizer using Haar Cascade classifiers, and records attendance in a CSV file with the user's name, date, and time.
